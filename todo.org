* DONE Update the README with the correct JSON file structure.
  CLOSED: [2019-01-23 Wed 15:45]
  This means we need to update to have everything that wasn't plural now become plural.  So far that list only
  consists of cuisines and courses.

* TODO Make the error checking more robust in the utility-function.js file.
  To make it more robust the testing should including checking for some basic valid inputs.  For example, we should
  not allow for people to do something like include a curse word in the name.  This should probably use a natural
  language processor at some point and may prove to be a huge task.  Checklist to follow as needed.

* TODO Fix const token in test-recipe-put-api.js
  We are currently just declaring a token object in the file and instead should maybe look to authenticate initially
  and then use that token to go forward.  Not sure if this is going to actually happen though.

* TODO Fix const token in test-recipe-get-api.js
  We might not even need it in there as we should be able to search for all recipes anyways.  Check to see if we
  actually do use this and if so handle appropriately.

* TODO Throw error on unit-converter.js converting from unit to unit.
  This should probably be a promise that I will be reject instead and kickng up the ladder.

* TODO Look into express-joi for data validation.
  This is a low priority and quite frankly something that would a nice to have in my toolbelt but we are already
  doing some major validation on the data ourselves.

* TODO Implement error for user creation.
  We curently just break the server if the user account creation attempt fails.  Probaly not the best way to handle
  things and it should be fixed at some point.  Also should do proper validation to make sure user accounts being
  created are legitimate accounts instead of spooofed accounts.
